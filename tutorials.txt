I followed the tutorial from:

There are several runners that I created, based on that tutorial

If you want to run integration tests, you have 1 mvn runner that needs to contain failsafe:integration-test, or you can
start the OpenLiberty server in dev mode, and then if you press enter in the console, it will run the tests automatically.
(from what I noticed, you might need to press twice enter)
